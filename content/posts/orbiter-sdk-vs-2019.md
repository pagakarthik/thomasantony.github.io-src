[Orbiter](http://orbit.medphys.ucl.ac.uk/) is for space flight, what X-Plane and Microsoft Flight Simulator are for aviation. A comprehensive collection of user-made addons are one of the main attractions of the simulator. Orbiter has been around since the early 2000s and it seems like some of the [documentation](https://www.orbiterwiki.org/wiki/Category:OrbiterSDK) for add-on development seems to be a bit out-dated. This post is my attempt to document how to get an Orbiter 2016 addon development environment set-up in Windows 10, in 2020 using tools available today.

## Download Orbiter 2016

"Tex" has a very good [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzcPO8rtLDQ) detailing how to install it along with some essential add-ons. [Orbiter-Forum](https://www.orbiter-forum.com) is also a great resource.
The rest of the post assumes that you have already installed Orbiter 2016 in `C:\Orbiter`.

## Download Visual Studio
